# Dental Health Chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project implements an interactive AI-powered dental health chatbot. The chatbot leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and context-aware responses to dental health-related queries. The bot retrieves relevant documents based on the userâ€™s query and uses a generative model (BioMistral-7B) to provide informative answers.

## Features
- **Medical Assistant Specializing in Dental Health**: Provides accurate responses to questions about dental symptoms, treatments, and prevention.
- **Contextual Responses**: Uses RAG to fetch relevant documents and generate responses based on the context.
- **Interactive Chat**: Users can interact with the chatbot by asking multiple questions in real-time.
- **Supports Dental Health Queries**: Topics covered include symptoms of dental conditions like gum disease, toothaches, treatments, prevention tips, and more.

## Acknowledgments
- **Hugging Face**: For providing the BioMistral-7B model.
- **LangChain**: For facilitating the RAG pipeline.
- **Chroma**: For document retrieval using vector search.
